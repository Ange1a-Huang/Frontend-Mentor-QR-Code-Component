## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I practiced using the flexbox system in CSS. I also practiced using vw and vh and making media queries to make responsive text sizes.

### Continued development

I will focus on making more efficient media queries next time and set up the breakpoints better so the design will look more uniform across the different screen sizes. 

I also want to use a mobile-first approach next time I develop a webpage since I didn't this time.

### Useful resources

- [max() CSS function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max) - I read this to learn how to use the max() function when I was setting a range of font sizes to make sure the text was still readable at different screen sizes. I also used the max() function to ensure that the corners of the box would be rounded to the same amount as that of the QR code image at 1440px and above.
- [Responsive text sizes using CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_responsive_text.asp) - I read this to see examples of using vw as a unit for font-size.
